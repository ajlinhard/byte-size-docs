# Model Context Protocol
A useful structure for allowing AI models to interact with external tools. This is quickly becoming the new standard for these type of interactions. Some people are liking it to APIs for AI Models.

The intial release of this protocol came from Anthropic at the end of 2024. In combination with newer release of protocols like Googles A2A, the building blocks for strong AI Agents inside of systems is growing.
