# Textract vs Docling vs PyMuPDF

## AWS Textract Features

**AWS Textract** is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, layout elements, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract specific data from documents.

### Key Features:

**Document Format Support:**
- Amazon Textract currently supports PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and PDF formats. For synchronous APIs, you can submit images either as an S3 object or as a byte array. For asynchronous APIs, you can submit S3 objects

**Text and Data Extraction:**
- Amazon Textract can detect printed text and handwriting from the Standard English alphabet and ASCII symbols. Amazon Textract can extract printed text, forms and tables in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese
- Amazon Textract also extracts explicitly labeled data, implied data, and line items from an itemized list of goods or services from almost any invoice or receipt in English without any templates or configuration

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- Amazon Textract can provide the inputs required to automatically process forms and tables without human intervention
- Amazon Textract can also extract specific or implied data such as names and addresses from identity documents in English such as U.S. passports and driver's licenses without the need for templates or configuration
- Query functionality: Amazon Textract can extract any specific data from documents without worrying about the structure or variations of the data in the document using Queries in English

**Processing Options:**
- Amazon Textract provides both synchronous and asynchronous API actions to extract document text and analyze the document text data. Synchronous APIs can be used for single-page documents and low-latency use cases such as mobile capture. Asynchronous APIs can be used for multipage documents such as PDF or TIFF documents with thousands of pages

**Limitations:**
- For PDF processing, Amazon Textract Asynchronous APIs only support document location as S3 objects - you cannot directly upload PDFs as byte arrays
- Cloud-based service requiring internet connectivity
- Pricing based on usage (per document/page processed)

## Docling Features

**Docling** is an open-source toolkit that simplifies document processing, parsing diverse formats — including advanced PDF understanding — and providing seamless integrations with the gen AI ecosystem.

### Key Features:

**Document Format Support:**
- Parsing of multiple document formats incl. PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, WAV, MP3, images (PNG, TIFF, JPEG, ...), and more

**Advanced PDF Understanding:**
- Advanced PDF understanding incl. page layout, reading order, table structure, code, formulas, image classification, and more
- Docling's TableFormer model recognizes complex table structures, including those with partial or no borderlines, spanning multiple rows or columns, or containing empty cells

**Output Formats:**
- Various export formats and options, including Markdown, HTML, DocTags and lossless JSON

**AI Integration:**
- Plug-and-play integrations incl. LangChain, LlamaIndex, Crew AI & Haystack for agentic AI

**Performance:**
- Tests conducted on a dataset of 225 pages revealed that Docling could process documents with sub-second latency per page on a single CPU. Specifically, on a MacBook Pro M3 Max with 16 cores, Docling processed 92 pages in just 103 seconds using 16 threads, achieving a throughput of 2.45 pages per second

**Privacy and Deployment:**
- Local execution capabilities for sensitive data and air-gapped environments

## PyMuPDF Features

**PyMuPDF** is a high-performance Python library for data extraction, analysis, conversion & manipulation of PDF (and other) documents.

### Key Features:

**Document Format Support:**
- MuPDF supports not only PDF, but also XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ, CBR, FB2 and EPUB formats

**Core Capabilities:**
- PDF Document Reading: PyMuPDF can open and read PDF documents, allowing you to access the text, images, and other content within them. Text Extraction: You can extract text from PDF documents, including text content, fonts, and layout information. Image Extraction: You can extract images from PDF documents in various formats, such as JPEG or PNG. Table Extraction: You can also extract tables from PDF documents

**Performance:**
- PyMuPDF and pypdfium consistently performing better in these document types across financial, legal, and manual document categories
- PyMuPDF and pypdfium significantly outperformed others, scoring F1 scores of 0.973 and 0.969 respectively in patent document processing

**Additional Features:**
- Tesseract-OCR for optical character recognition in images and document pages
- Support for document manipulation and creation
- Local processing with no external dependencies for basic functionality

## Comparison Summary

### **Accuracy and Quality**

**AWS Textract** excels in structured data extraction with ML-powered analysis but requires cloud connectivity and has usage costs.

**Docling** shows strong performance with its use of advanced models like DocLayNet and TableFormer ensures reliable handling of diverse document elements, with only minor omissions and is described as the recommended choice for applications requiring scalability and accuracy, such as enterprise data processing and business intelligence.

**PyMuPDF** demonstrates consistently high F1 scores across most tools and is particularly strong for patent and scientific documents.

### **Speed and Performance**

**AWS Textract**: Cloud processing with variable latency depending on document size and API type (sync vs async).

**Docling**: sub-second latency per page on a single CPU with excellent local processing performance.

**PyMuPDF**: High-performance local processing, particularly efficient for basic text extraction.

### **Use Case Recommendations**

- **AWS Textract**: Best for enterprise applications requiring pre-built AI models for forms, invoices, and identity documents, where cloud processing is acceptable.

- **Docling**: Ideal for AI/ML workflows, RAG applications, and scenarios requiring local processing with strong structural understanding.

- **PyMuPDF**: Perfect for high-volume, fast text extraction and basic document manipulation where you need full local control and minimal dependencies.

The choice between these tools depends on your specific requirements for accuracy, performance, deployment constraints, and integration needs.
