# SOAP vs REST APIs
**REST (Representational State Transfer)** and **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** are two different architectural approaches for building APIs that allow software applications to communicate with each other.

## REST APIs

REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and is resource-oriented. Key characteristics:

- **Uses HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations
- **Stateless** - each request contains all necessary information
- **Works with multiple formats** - typically JSON, but also XML, HTML, plain text
- **Resource-based** - URLs represent resources (e.g., `/users/123`)
- **Lightweight and flexible** - easier to use and understand
- **More popular for modern web services** and mobile applications

## SOAP APIs

SOAP is a protocol with strict standards for message format and communication. Key characteristics:

- **XML-only** - all messages must be in XML format
- **Protocol-independent** - can work over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, and more
- **Built-in error handling** - standardized fault messages
- **Strict contracts** - uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to define the interface
- **Enterprise-focused** - better for complex transactions requiring high security
- **More overhead** - verbose XML structure makes messages larger

## Key Performance Criteria

When evaluating API performance, consider these critical factors:

**Response Time/Latency** - How quickly the API responds to requests. This includes network latency, processing time, and data serialization/deserialization.

**Throughput** - The number of requests the API can handle per second. This measures the system's capacity under load.

**Payload Size** - The amount of data transferred in requests and responses. REST typically has smaller payloads (JSON) compared to SOAP's verbose XML, affecting bandwidth and speed.

**Resource Utilization** - CPU, memory, and network bandwidth consumption on both client and server sides.

**Scalability** - The ability to maintain performance as the number of concurrent users or requests increases.

**Reliability and Error Rates** - The percentage of successful requests versus failures, and how gracefully the API handles errors.

**Security Overhead** - The performance impact of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.

**Caching Effectiveness** - How well the API leverages caching to reduce redundant processing and network calls.

In general, REST APIs tend to perform better for most modern use cases due to lighter payloads and simpler processing, while SOAP may be preferred when you need guaranteed message delivery, built-in retry logic, or are working in enterprise environments with existing SOAP infrastructure.
