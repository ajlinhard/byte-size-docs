# AWS Cloud Practioner
I highly recommend completing this certification if you have no cloud experience, very limited, or are struggling in the job market. The class covers the basics of the cloud infrastructure on AWS, so you can speak the language in most high level cloud conversations. The material to complete the studying is all free and the videos are very well done.

**Exam Details:**
- **Format:** 65 questions; either multiple choice or multiple response
- **Duration:** 120 minutes
- **Cost:** $150 USD
- **Validity:** This certification is valid for 3 years
