# File Transfer Services Overview
AWS Transfer Family is a set of fully managed file transfer services that enable you to transfer files directly into and out of Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx using standard file transfer protocols. It eliminates the need to manage file transfer infrastructure while providing secure, scalable, and reliable file transfers.

## Available Services

**AWS Transfer for SFTP** - Supports Secure File Transfer Protocol, the most commonly used secure file transfer protocol in enterprise environments.

**AWS Transfer for FTPS** - Supports File Transfer Protocol Secure, which adds SSL/TLS encryption to traditional FTP.

**AWS Transfer for FTP** - Supports standard File Transfer Protocol for scenarios where encryption isn't required (typically internal networks).

**AWS Transfer for AS2** - Supports Applicability Statement 2 protocol, commonly used for business-to-business (B2B) data exchange, particularly in EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) scenarios.

## General Purpose

AWS Transfer Family serves as a bridge between traditional file transfer workflows and modern cloud storage. It allows organizations to maintain their existing file transfer processes and client applications while seamlessly moving data to AWS storage services. The service handles protocol translation, user authentication, and file routing automatically.

## Common Use Cases

**Data Migration** - Moving large datasets from on-premises systems to AWS cloud storage without changing existing file transfer processes or retraining users.

**B2B File Exchange** - Enabling partners, vendors, and customers to securely exchange files with your organization using familiar protocols, while automatically storing files in your AWS environment.

**Content Distribution** - Allowing content creators, media companies, or distributors to upload large files (like video content) directly to S3 for further processing or distribution.

**Backup and Archival** - Providing a familiar interface for backup systems that traditionally used SFTP/FTP protocols to send data to remote locations.

**Regulatory Compliance** - Supporting industries with strict data handling requirements by providing audit trails, encryption in transit, and integration with AWS security services.

**Legacy System Integration** - Connecting older applications that rely on file transfers to modern cloud infrastructure without requiring application modifications.

**Data Lake Ingestion** - Serving as an entry point for external data sources to contribute files to data lakes built on Amazon S3.

The service is particularly valuable for organizations that need to maintain compatibility with existing file transfer processes while gaining the benefits of cloud storage, such as scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness.
