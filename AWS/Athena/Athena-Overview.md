# AWS Athena Overview
Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service. You can use it to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With Athena, you can run complex queries on large datasets. You don't need to set up or manage any infrastructure. It works like a powerful SQL engine that's always ready to use. You can instantly dive into your data lake and extract valuable insights.

The ability of Athena to query data in place eliminates the need for complex extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes. This makes it a useful tool for one-time analysis and exploration of large datasets. Whether you're dealing with log files, clickstream data, or business reports, Athena provides a flexible and scalable solution for your data analysis needs.

## Features
1. Athena helps analyze large datasets in Amazon S3. You can use standard SQL to analyze Amazon S3 data directly.
2. Athena also offers a lists of prebuilt data source connectors so that you can use SQL to query a variety of data sources external to Amazon S3 such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, Google BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake Storage, Redis, Snowflake, and SAP Hana.
3. It also adjusts resources based on your query needs, which makes the service cost-effective.
4. It connects with AWS Glue for catalog management and integrates with Amazon QuickSight for data visualization. Athena also works with AWS Lambda for serverless processing. This creates powerful analytics solutions.

## Benefits
### Serverless convenience
With Athena, you can bypass the complexities of infrastructure management and dive straight into data analysis. Because there's no need to manage servers, you can begin running queries instantly. This serverless approach saves time on initial configuration and removes maintenance efforts.

### Pay-per-query pricing
With Athena, you only pay for the queries you run. This makes it cost-effective for both occasional and frequent use cases.

### Rapid data insights
Athena enables quick analysis of large datasets stored in Amazon S3. It provides fast query results without the need for data movement or ETL processes.

### SQL familiarity
Athena uses standard SQL, so developers and analysts can use their existing SQL skills for querying data in the cloud.

### Integration with AWS
Athena seamlessly integrates with other AWS services and enhances your ability to build comprehensive data analytics solutions in the cloud.

### Schema flexibility
Athena supports various data formats and can automatically infer schemas to reduce the time and effort required to prepare data for analysis.

## Cost
Athena follows a pay-per-use pricing model, so you only pay for the queries you run against your data in Amazon S3. There are two components to Athena pricing: the amount of data scanned by each query and the per-query cost.

#### Data Scanned per Query
For the data scanned, Athena charges per terabyte. This charge is calculated based on the amount of data that is filtered and processed by your query, not the total size of the data stored in Amazon S3. So, even if you have petabytes of data in Amazon S3, you only pay for the portion your query actually touches.

Now that you have reviewed data scanned per query, proceed to the next tab to learn about per-query cost.

#### Per-Query Cost
In addition to the data scanning charge, Athena has a per-query cost for queries that complete successfully. Failed queries are not charged. This per-query fee helps cover the costs of running the Athena service.

Now, that you have reviewed Athena's pricing structure, continue reading to understand its cost-effectiveness and optimization strategies.

# Technical Backend
Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that gives you the ability to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It uses a distributed SQL engine called Presto, which allows it to handle large-scale datasets efficiently. It supports various data formats, including .csv, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet, so it's versatile for different data types.

Athena provides built-in data sources connectors to 30 popular AWS, on premises, and other cloud data stores, including Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, Google BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake Storage, Redis, Snowflake, and SAP Hana. By using Athena data source connectors, you can generate insights from multiple data sources using the Athena SQL syntax and without the need to move or transform your data.

The Athena architecture is designed to separate storage and compute, which allows on-demand querying without provisioning or managing infrastructure. With this approach, you can focus on data analysis instead of infrastructure management. This makes Athena a powerful tool for one-time queries, BI, and data exploration.

### Serverless
This is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure so you can focus on writing and executing code without worrying about server management.

### SQL
This is a standardized language used for managing and querying relational databases, which Athena uses to interact with data stored in Amazon S3.

### Presto
This is a distributed SQL query engine optimized for low-latency, one-time analysis of large datasets. Athena uses Presto as its underlying query-processing system.

### Data format
This refers to the structure and organization of data files, such as .csv, JSON, ORC, Avro, or Parquet, which Athena can read and query directly from Amazon S3.

### Partition
This is an organization of data into Amazon S3 directories based on a particular property of the data. This organization can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.

For example, data about product sales might be partitioned by date, product category, and market.

### Schema
This refers to the structure and organization of a database, including tables, and relationships between them. Athena uses schema to understand and query data in Amazon S3.

### Query execution
This is the process of running a SQL query against data stored in Amazon S3, which Athena manages automatically, including resource allocation and optimization.

### Data catalog
This is a central repository of metadata about data sources, tables, and schemas, which Athena uses to understand the structure of data stored in Amazon S3.

### Data source connector
A data source connector is a piece of code that runs on Lambda that translates between your target data source and Athena.

# Athena in Use

## Amazon S3
Athena is tightly integrated with Amazon S3, so you can query data directly from S3 buckets without the need for data movement or separate data stores. This streamlines data processing architectures and reduces operational overhead.

## AWS Glue
AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that can automatically crawl and catalog data stored in Amazon S3. It integrates with Athena to offer data querying from multiple sources. These sources include relational databases, data lakes, and streaming data. The AWS Glue Data Catalog serves as the metadata store for this integration. Data queried by Athena does not need to be discovered and cataloged by AWS Glue, though it's often beneficial to do so.

**Athena can work without Glue in several ways:**
You can manually create table definitions directly in Athena using DDL (Data Definition Language) statements. This involves writing CREATE TABLE statements that specify the schema, data format, and S3 location of your data files.

Athena also supports querying data directly without creating tables by using techniques like querying CSV files with column headers or using the MSCK REPAIR TABLE command for partitioned data that follows Hive-style naming conventions.

**However, using Glue provides significant advantages:**
The Glue Data Catalog serves as Athena's default metastore, automatically discovering schema information, data types, and partition structures. This eliminates manual table creation and reduces the chance of errors in schema definitions.

Glue crawlers can automatically detect new data, schema changes, and partitions, keeping your catalog current without manual intervention. This is particularly valuable for frequently changing datasets or complex partitioning schemes.

The catalog also enables better data governance, making it easier to share metadata across different analytics tools beyond just Athena, including Redshift, EMR, and third-party tools.

**In practice**, while you can use Athena standalone for simple, one-off queries or well-understood datasets, most production environments benefit from the automation and metadata management that Glue provides. The choice often depends on your data complexity, team size, and how frequently your data structure changes.

## QuickSight
QuickSight is a cloud-based business intelligence (BI) service that gives you the ability to create interactive dashboards and visualizations from data sources. By connecting Athena to QuickSight, you can create powerful data visualizations and share insights with stakeholders directly from your Athena queries.

## Lambda
Lambda is a serverless compute service that gives you the ability to run code without provisioning or managing servers. By integrating with Lambda, Athena can start custom code based on query results to enable advanced data processing and automation scenarios.

## Kinesis
Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed streaming data service that can collect and process large streams of data records in real time. By integrating with Kinesis, Athena can query and analyze streaming data sources to enable real-time data analytics and monitor use cases.

## CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events to provide a comprehensive audit trail of actions taken in your AWS account. By integrating with CloudTrail, Athena can query and analyze log data to enable security and compliance monitoring, in addition to operational troubleshooting.

## Amazon Sagemaker
With Amazon Athena you can write SQL statements that invoke Amazon SageMaker Artificial Intelligence (A)I models to perform complex tasks such anomaly detection or sales predictions.
