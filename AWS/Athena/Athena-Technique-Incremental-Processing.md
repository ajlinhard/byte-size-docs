# Athena Technique Incremental Processing
In Delta Lake you can incrementally process data via quite a few techniques. Incremental processing in Athena is not straight forward for the following reasons in this article.

## **Materialized Views:** 
Athena does not have native materialized views. Unlike traditional databases, Athena doesn't support creating materialized views that automatically refresh when underlying data changes.

**Workarounds for materialized view functionality:**
- Use **CTAS (Create Table As Select)** to create snapshot tables of your query results
- Schedule these CTAS operations using AWS Step Functions, Lambda, or other orchestration tools
- Store the results as Parquet files in S3 for better query performance

## **Incremental Processing:** 
Athena also lacks native incremental processing capabilities. It doesn't have built-in change detection or delta processing features.

**Alternatives for incremental processing:**

**Time-based partitioning** is the most common approach - partition your data by date/time and only process new partitions:
```sql
-- Only process today's data
SELECT * FROM my_table 
WHERE partition_date = CURRENT_DATE
```

**Use AWS Glue for ETL** - Glue supports incremental processing patterns like:
- Bookmarking to track processed data
- Change data capture (CDC) capabilities
- Job scheduling for regular incremental updates

**Delta Lake on Athena** - While not native, you can use Delta Lake format on S3 with Athena, which provides some incremental processing capabilities through delta tables.

**Third-party solutions** like Apache Iceberg or Apache Hudi can be used with Athena for more advanced incremental patterns.

**Best practices for incremental patterns in Athena:**
- Design your data with time-based partitions from the start
- Use external orchestration (Step Functions, Airflow) to manage incremental workflows
- Combine Athena with Glue for complex transformation needs
- Consider using AWS Lake Formation for data governance and incremental data management

The lack of these native features reflects Athena's design as a serverless query engine rather than a full data warehouse platform - it's optimized for ad-hoc analytics rather than ongoing data processing workflows.
