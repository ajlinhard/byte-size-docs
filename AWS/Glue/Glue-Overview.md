# Glue Overview
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service, which means that you only pay for usage and don't pay for idle time. With AWS Glue, data scientists, analysts, and developers can discover, prepare, and combine data for various purposes. Examples include analytics, machine learning (ML), and application development. AWS Glue provides visual and code-based interfaces for data integration activity and transforms data using built-in transformations. 

You can also quickly locate and access data through the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Data engineers and extract, transform, and load (ETL) developers can create, run, and monitor ETL workflows using AWS Glue Studio. Data analysts can use the no-code capabilities of AWS Glue DataBrew to enrich, clean, and normalize data without writing any code. Data scientists can use AWS Glue interactive notebooks to quickly start querying their data for interactive analytics, rather than spending months creating infrastructure.
