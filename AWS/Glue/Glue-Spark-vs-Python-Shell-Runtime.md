# Glue Spark vs Python Shell Runtime
The AWS Glue RDS connector can work under the Spark runtime but fail under the Python Shell runtime because **the two runtimes have fundamentally different architectures, dependency environments, and connection-handling models**.

### Key Differences Between Glue Spark and Python Shell Jobs

| Aspect | Glue Spark Runtime | Glue Python Shell Runtime |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Execution environment** | Distributed Spark cluster running on managed AWS Glue infrastructure | Single EC2 instance runtime, similar to a lightweight Lambda environment [1][2] |
| **Built-in connector support** | Includes built-in JDBC drivers for RDS engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) and native `connectionType` integration via Data Catalog | Lacks preinstalled JDBC drivers; you must explicitly install and manage dependencies like `psycopg2`, `pyodbc`, or `mysqlclient` via `--additional-python-modules` or preloaded `.whl` files [3][4] |
| **Connection objects** | Glue `Connection` resources in the Data Catalog can be directly referenced using `connectionType` and `connectionOptions` parameters | Python Shell jobs do not automatically interpret Glue `Connection` objects; network and credential handling must be coded manually [5][6] |
| **Network access** | Automatically provisions network interfaces within your VPC for JDBC connections (if configured) | You must manually configure subnet and security group settings; missing VPC endpoints or rules often block access to RDS [7][8] |
| **Driver management** | JDBC drivers are natively included and automatically managed | You must upload and reference driver jars or Python packages yourself [3] |

### Why the Connector Works in Spark But Not Python Shell

1. **Driver Inclusion**  
   The Spark runtime embeds JDBC drivers for RDS connections, meaning no external dependency management is needed. The Python Shell runtime does not, so connectors like SQL Server or PostgreSQL need manual driver inclusion.

2. **Glue Connection Object Handling**  
   Glue Spark jobs natively interpret catalog connection configurations (`connectionType=postgresql`, etc.), while Python Shell jobs treat these as ordinary parameters without automatic binding.

3. **Network Configuration Differences**  
   Spark jobs handle private subnet routing and VPC attachments automatically when Glue connections are defined correctly. The Python Shell runtime does not, and will fail without explicit `--security-group-ids` and `--subnet-id` job parameters or correct IAM/VPC endpoint setup.

4. **Environment and Dependency Management**  
   Python Shell jobs use an isolated environment that lacks the JVM-based Spark connectors and often needs libraries installed via `--additional-python-modules` or bundled `.whl`/`.zip` uploads.[9]

### Typical Fix for Python Shell Jobs

- Upload appropriate database drivers (e.g., `psycopg2-binary` or `mysqlclient`) using Glue’s “Python library path” option.  
- Use a direct Python client library connection string rather than a Glue `connectionType`.  
- Ensure the job runs inside the same VPC/subnet as the RDS instance and that the Glue service role has needed access to RDS and S3.  

In summary, the RDS connector works seamlessly on the Spark runtime because AWS natively integrates database connectivity and networking for Spark-based ETL—but not for Python Shell jobs, which must manage dependencies and connectivityvity manually.

# Why Python Shell does NOT use connectors:
When using **AWS Glue Python Shell** jobs to access **Amazon RDS**, you typically **do not use Glue connectors** (which are intended for Spark-based runtimes). Instead, you manage the connection through **direct Python drivers** (e.g., `PyMySQL`, `psycopg2`, or `pyodbc`) along with proper **network and IAM configuration**.

### Why Not Use Glue Connectors in Python Shell
Glue connectors (and catalog `Connection` objects) are primarily designed for the **Glue Spark runtime**, which integrates JDBC drivers automatically for RDS, Redshift, and other databases. The Python Shell runtime doesn’t leverage this built-in infrastructure, so even if you attach a Glue connection object, the job won’t automatically use it.[1][2]

### Recommended Approach for Python Shell Jobs

1. **Handle the Database Connection Manually**
   Use native Python libraries (like `PyMySQL` for MySQL, `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, or `pyodbc` for SQL Server). For example, AWS’s documentation shows a direct MySQL connection:
   ```python
   import boto3, pymysql
   client = boto3.client('rds')
   token = client.generate_db_auth_token(DBHostname="rds-endpoint",
                                         Port=3306,
                                         DBUsername="dbuser",
                                         Region="us-east-1")
   conn = pymysql.connect(host="rds-endpoint",
                          user="dbuser",
                          password=token,
                          ssl_ca='global-bundle.pem',
                          database="mydb")
   ```
   This approach supports IAM authentication via `generate_db_auth_token`, avoiding the need for static credentials.[3]

2. **Network and Security Group Access**
   The Python shell job must run in the same **VPC, subnet, and security group** that has access to your RDS instance. You configure this in the Glue job’s network properties. Make sure the RDS instance’s SG allows inbound traffic from the Glue job’s SG.[4]

3. **IAM Role Permissions**
   The Glue job’s IAM role should include `rds-db:connect` and `rds:GenerateDBAuthToken` permissions if you use IAM authentication.

4. **Dependency Management**
   Since Python Shell doesn’t include all database drivers by default, use:
   - The `--additional-python-modules` parameter, or  
   - Upload `.whl`/`.egg` library files to S3 and reference them via the **Python library path** property.[5][6]

### Summary
Glue Python Shell jobs should **connect directly to RDS using native Python clients**, **not Glue connectors**. You control connectivity using **network (VPC/subnet/SG)** configuration and **IAM roles**. Glue connectors remain relevant for **Spark-based Glue jobs** but are functionally bypassed in Python Shell environments.
