# AWS Cloud Formation Overview
AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables users to provision and manage AWS resources by treating infrastructure as code. It uses templates, typically written in JSON or YAML, to define the desired state of your infrastructure, and CloudFormation then handles the creation, updating, and deletion of those resources.
