# Lambda Security Accessing Other Services
This reveals an important distinction between **public access** and **authenticated access** in AWS.

## S3 "Block Public Access" ≠ Block All Access

When you enable **"Block all public access"** on an S3 bucket, you're specifically blocking:
- Anonymous/unauthenticated requests
- Public read/write permissions via bucket policies or ACLs
- Cross-account public access

**But it does NOT block:**
- Authenticated requests from AWS services
- Requests using proper IAM credentials
- Access from within your AWS account (with proper permissions)

## How Lambda Accesses "Private" S3 Buckets

Your Lambda function can write to a private S3 bucket through:

**1. IAM Execution Role**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-private-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. AWS's Internal Authentication**
- Lambda automatically uses its execution role credentials
- AWS services communicate using internal authentication mechanisms
- The request is signed with valid AWS credentials

**3. Network Path Options**

**Option A: Lambda outside VPC (most common)**
```
Lambda (AWS managed network) → S3 Private API → Your Private Bucket
```
- Uses AWS's internal backbone
- Still authenticated via IAM
- No public internet involved

**Option B: Lambda in VPC with Gateway Endpoint**
```
Lambda (Private Subnet) → VPC S3 Gateway Endpoint → Your Private Bucket
```
- Traffic never leaves your VPC
- Still uses IAM authentication
- Most secure option

**Option C: Lambda in VPC with NAT Gateway**
```
Lambda (Private Subnet) → NAT Gateway → Internet → S3 Public API → Your Private Bucket
```
- Goes over public internet (less secure)
- Still authenticated via IAM
- Bucket remains private to unauthorized users

## Key Point

**"Block public access" blocks unauthorized users, not authorized AWS services.** Your Lambda function, with proper IAM permissions, is an authorized service making authenticated requests.

Think of it like a private office building - the building blocks random people from walking in (public access blocked), but employees with proper keycards (IAM credentials) can still enter and work.

The S3 bucket remains completely private to the outside world while still being accessible to your authenticated AWS resources.
