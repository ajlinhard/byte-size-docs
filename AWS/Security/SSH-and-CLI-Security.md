# SSH and CLI Security
SSH (Secure Shell) and CLI (Command Line Interface) serve different purposes when working with cloud services:

**CLI vs SSH:**
- **CLI** is the interface - it's how you interact with systems using text commands instead of a graphical interface
- **SSH** is a secure protocol for connecting to remote machines over a network

When working with cloud services, you typically use both together. For example, you might use your local CLI to run an SSH command that connects you to a remote cloud server, where you then use that server's CLI.

**Why separate public keys are needed:**

SSH uses public-key cryptography for authentication, which requires a key pair:

**The key pair consists of:**
- A **private key** (stays on your local machine, never shared)
- A **public key** (gets copied to remote servers you want to access)

**Why this separation matters:**
- **Security**: Your private key never leaves your machine. Even if someone intercepts network traffic, they can't impersonate you without your private key
- **Convenience**: Once set up, you can connect without typing passwords repeatedly
- **Access control**: Cloud servers only grant access to users whose public keys are in their authorized list

**How it works:**
1. You generate a key pair on your local machine
2. You add your public key to the cloud server (usually in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`)
3. When you SSH to the server, it uses your public key to verify you have the corresponding private key
4. If verification succeeds, you're granted access

This is much more secure than password authentication because private keys are much harder to guess or intercept than passwords.

## EC2 Key Pairs for SSH
EC2 key pairs are AWS's implementation of SSH key pairs specifically for accessing EC2 instances (virtual servers). They're essentially the same concept as regular SSH keys, but managed through AWS.

**What EC2 key pairs are:**
- A public/private key pair that AWS generates or that you import
- The private key (`.pem` file) stays with you
- AWS stores the public key and automatically installs it on EC2 instances you launch

**Why they're needed:**

**Security by default:** AWS EC2 instances don't come with default passwords. Without key pairs, you'd have no way to securely access your instances after launch.

**Secure remote access:** They provide encrypted, password-less authentication to log into your EC2 instances via SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows).

**Better than passwords:** Key-based authentication is much more secure than password authentication - private keys are virtually impossible to brute-force.

**How they work with EC2:**

1. **Create/import key pair:** You generate a key pair in the AWS console or import an existing public key
2. **Launch instance:** When launching an EC2 instance, you specify which key pair to use
3. **AWS installs public key:** AWS automatically places your public key in the instance's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
4. **Connect:** You use your private key file to SSH into the instance:
   ```bash
   ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@instance-ip-address
   ```

**Important notes:**
- If you lose your private key file, you're locked out of your instance permanently
- You can't retrieve the private key from AWS - they only store the public portion
- Different EC2 instance types use different default usernames (ec2-user, ubuntu, admin, etc.)

This system ensures that only people with the correct private key can access your cloud servers, which is critical for security in cloud environments.

# Using Boto3 + CLI vs SSH
Boto3 clients and SSH represent two fundamentally different ways of accessing AWS resources, each with distinct security models and use cases.

**Security Models:**

**Boto3 (AWS SDK):**
- Uses **AWS IAM credentials** (Access Key ID + Secret Access Key)
- Authenticates against **AWS APIs** 
- Access controlled by **IAM policies** that define exactly which AWS services/actions are allowed
- All communication goes through AWS's API endpoints over HTTPS
- Supports temporary credentials via **STS** (Security Token Service)

**SSH:**
- Uses **public/private key pairs** for authentication
- Provides **direct shell access** to the operating system
- Once connected, your access depends on the **Linux user permissions** and sudo privileges
- Communication encrypted via SSH protocol
- Access is binary - you either have shell access or you don't

**Pros and Cons:**

**Boto3 Advantages:**
- **Granular permissions**: IAM policies can restrict access to specific AWS services, actions, and even resources
- **Temporary credentials**: Can use roles with automatic credential rotation
- **Audit trail**: All API calls logged in CloudTrail
- **No OS-level access**: Can't accidentally damage the underlying system
- **Scalable**: Works programmatically across many resources
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Can enforce MFA for sensitive operations

**Boto3 Disadvantages:**
- **Limited to AWS services**: Can't perform general system administration
- **API-only**: Can't troubleshoot OS-level issues or install custom software
- **Learning curve**: Need to understand AWS APIs and services
- **Indirect access**: Can't directly examine logs, processes, or file systems

**SSH Advantages:**
- **Full system access**: Can perform any system administration task
- **Direct troubleshooting**: Can examine logs, processes, network configurations
- **Install anything**: Can install packages, modify configurations, debug applications
- **Familiar interface**: Standard Linux/Unix command line tools
- **Emergency access**: Can fix issues that prevent AWS API access

**SSH Disadvantages:**
- **Broad access**: Hard to limit what someone can do once they have shell access
- **Security risk**: Full OS access means potential for system damage or data exposure
- **Key management**: Private keys can be lost, stolen, or compromised
- **Less auditing**: Actions within the OS may not be as well logged
- **Instance-specific**: Need separate access to each EC2 instance

**When to use each:**

**Use Boto3 for:**
- Deploying applications
- Managing AWS resources (S3, Lambda, RDS, etc.)
- Automated workflows and scripts
- CI/CD pipelines
- Application code that needs to interact with AWS services

**Use SSH for:**
- System administration and maintenance
- Debugging application issues on EC2 instances
- Installing software or configuring services
- Accessing application logs on the server
- Emergency troubleshooting when AWS APIs aren't working

**Security best practices:**
- **Principle of least privilege**: Use IAM policies to grant minimal necessary permissions for Boto3
- **Rotate credentials**: Regularly rotate both AWS keys and SSH keys
- **Use temporary credentials**: Prefer IAM roles over long-term access keys when possible
- **Bastion hosts**: Use jump servers for SSH access rather than direct internet exposure
- **Session logging**: Log SSH sessions for security auditing

Many organizations use both methods together - Boto3 for application deployment and resource management, SSH for system administration when needed.
