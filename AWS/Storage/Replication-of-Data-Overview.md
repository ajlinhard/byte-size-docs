# Replication of Data Overview

For data syncs faster than every hour, you have several alternatives to consider depending on your specific use case:

## Event-Driven DataSync with Lambda
**Best for: Immediate response to file changes**
- Use AWS Lambda with Amazon EventBridge to trigger DataSync tasks more frequently
- Set up S3 event notifications to trigger Lambda functions that start DataSync tasks
- Can achieve near real-time syncing when files are added/modified
- Still uses DataSync's reliability and verification features

## Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
**Best for: S3-to-S3 transfers with sub-second latency**
- Automatic, real-time replication of S3 objects
- Replicates objects within 15 minutes (typically much faster)
- Works across regions and accounts
- Built-in encryption and versioning support
- Lower operational overhead than scheduled tasks

## AWS Storage Gateway
**Best for: Hybrid scenarios with on-premises integration**
- File Gateway: Provides NFS/SMB access with automatic S3 sync
- Volume Gateway: Block storage with point-in-time snapshots
- Near real-time data transfer to AWS

## Custom Solutions with AWS CLI/SDK
**Best for: Maximum flexibility**
- Build custom sync logic using AWS CLI or SDKs
- Can run as frequently as needed (every few minutes)
- Use with cron jobs, Lambda functions, or containerized applications
- Requires more development and maintenance effort

## Amazon EFS with Regional Replication
**Best for: File system workloads**
- Automatic replication between EFS file systems
- Near real-time sync for file system data
- Good for applications requiring shared file access

## Recommendation
For most use cases requiring sub-hourly syncing, I'd recommend:

1. **S3 Cross-Region Replication** if you're moving data between S3 buckets
2. **Event-driven DataSync with Lambda** if you need DataSync's advanced features (verification, filtering, etc.) but want faster triggering
3. **Custom solutions** only if you have specific requirements that other services can't meet

The event-driven DataSync approach gives you the best of both worlds - DataSync's robustness with more flexible scheduling.
