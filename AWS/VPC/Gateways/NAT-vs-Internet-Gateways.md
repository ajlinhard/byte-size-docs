# NAT vs Internet Gateways
NAT Gateways and Internet Gateways serve different purposes in AWS networking, and NAT Gateways provide additional security layers:

## NAT Gateways
**Purpose:** Allow instances in private subnets to access the internet for outbound traffic (like software updates) while preventing inbound internet traffic from reaching them.

**How they work:**
- Deployed in public subnets
- Translate private IP addresses to public IPs for outbound requests
- Only allow return traffic for connections initiated from inside the VPC
- Block all unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet

## Internet Gateways
**Purpose:** Provide direct bidirectional internet access for instances in public subnets.

**How they work:**
- Attached directly to the VPC
- Allow both inbound and outbound internet traffic
- Instances need public IP addresses to communicate through them

## Why NAT Gateways are Safer

**1. Unidirectional Access**
- NAT Gateways only allow outbound-initiated connections
- Internet Gateways allow bidirectional traffic, exposing instances to incoming attacks

**2. Private Subnet Isolation**
- Instances behind NAT Gateways remain in private subnets with no direct internet exposure
- Instances using Internet Gateways must be in public subnets with public IPs

**3. Attack Surface Reduction**
- NAT Gateways hide internal network topology and IP addresses
- Internet Gateways expose instances directly to internet scanning and attacks

**4. Stateful Connection Tracking**
- NAT Gateways maintain connection state, only allowing return traffic for established connections
- Provides an additional layer of traffic filtering

This architecture follows the principle of least privilege - giving instances only the internet access they need while minimizing exposure to threats.
