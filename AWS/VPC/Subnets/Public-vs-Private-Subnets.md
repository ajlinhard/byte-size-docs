# Public vs Private Subnets
A **public subnet** and **private subnet** differ in their internet accessibility and routing configuration:

## Public Subnet
- Has a route table with a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Resources can have public IP addresses and direct internet access
- Can both receive inbound traffic from the internet and send outbound traffic
- Typically used for web servers, load balancers, bastion hosts

## Private Subnet
- No direct route to an Internet Gateway
- Resources cannot be directly accessed from the internet
- No public IP addresses assigned to instances
- Typically used for databases, application servers, internal services

## Can Private Subnets Reach APIs?

**Yes, absolutely!** Private subnets can reach external APIs through several methods:

**1. NAT Gateway/Instance**
- Most common approach
- NAT Gateway in a public subnet allows outbound internet access
- Private subnet route table points to the NAT Gateway for internet destinations
- Enables API calls while keeping resources private

**2. VPC Endpoints**
- For AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB, Lambda)
- Private connection without going through the internet
- More secure and often faster than going through a NAT Gateway

**3. Direct Connect or VPN**
- For private APIs in other networks
- Establishes private connectivity without using the public internet

**Example scenario:** Your application servers in a private subnet can call external payment APIs, send emails through SendGrid, or fetch data from third-party REST APIs - they just route through a NAT Gateway rather than having direct internet access.

The key distinction is that private subnets can initiate outbound connections but cannot receive unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet.
