# Loose vs. Tight Coupling

**Tight coupling** means components are highly dependent on one another. Changes in one component often require changes in other components.

**Loose coupling** means components are relatively independent, interacting through well-defined interfaces or abstractions. Changes in one component rarely affect other components.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Tight Coupling | Loose Coupling |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Dependency** | Direct dependencies between components | Dependencies on abstractions/interfaces |
| **Knowledge** | Components know many details about each other | Components know minimal details about each other |
| **Change Impact** | Changes often propagate through the system | Changes are typically isolated |
| **Flexibility** | Hard to modify, extend, or replace components | Easy to modify, extend, or replace components |
| **Testing** | Difficult to test components in isolation | Easy to test components in isolation |
| **Reusability** | Components less reusable | Components more reusable |

## Examples

**Tight Coupling:**
```python
class DatabaseService:
    def save_user(self, user):
        # Database-specific code

class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_service = DatabaseService()  # Direct dependency
        
    def create_user(self, user_data):
        # Process user data
        self.db_service.save_user(user_data)
```

**Loose Coupling:**
```python
class DataStorageInterface:
    def save_user(self, user):
        pass

class DatabaseService(DataStorageInterface):
    def save_user(self, user):
        # Database-specific code

class UserService:
    def __init__(self, storage_service: DataStorageInterface):
        self.storage = storage_service  # Dependency on abstraction
        
    def create_user(self, user_data):
        # Process user data
        self.storage.save_user(user_data)
```

Loose coupling is generally preferred in software design as it leads to more maintainable, testable, and flexible systems.
