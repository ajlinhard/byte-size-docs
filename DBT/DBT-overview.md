# DBT (Data Build Tool) Overview
DBT is a interesting tool in the process of building out ELT flows (Extract Load Transform) this now a standard practice for ingesting data. Initial make not adjustments to the data just load it into the environment. Then make a series of transformations, joins, and aggregations of the loaded data into different data sets (or models in DBT terms). The data sets can branch and reconnet as the flow progresses. DBT can be helpful for tracking and versioning these model flows. I am skeptical if the features and abilities of DBT will survive the progress and advent of the real-time data progess. Just my opinion thoough.

Regardless the concepts and methods of DBT are useful for any Data Engineer or Data Scientist to understand.
