# Unity Catalog Compute
One of the powerful difference between Spark, Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift and more cloud data services is the separation of storage and compute. Learning how to setup and modulate your compute in each tool can effect your performance and cost. Therefore learning the compute options and settings in each is important. Databricks is no different!
