# Architecture and Systems Design
We creating a system or applications there are some common concepts for how to design the code. There will always be uniqueness to how the code function or interacts, but the relative concept and general use cases will be the same.

Here are the major software system design structures with their functions and use cases:

## Architectural Patterns

**Monolithic Architecture** - All components are deployed as a single unit. Functions by having all services tightly coupled within one application. Used for simple applications, rapid prototyping, and small teams where deployment simplicity is prioritized over scalability.

**Microservices Architecture** - Applications are broken into small, independent services that communicate over networks. Functions through distributed services with their own databases and deployment cycles. Used in large-scale applications requiring independent scaling, technology diversity, and team autonomy.

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** - Services are designed as reusable business functions accessible through well-defined interfaces. Functions by exposing business capabilities as services that can be composed into larger applications. Used in enterprise environments for system integration and business process automation.

## Communication Patterns

**Event-Driven Architecture** - Components communicate through events rather than direct calls. Functions by producers publishing events that consumers react to asynchronously. Used in real-time systems, IoT applications, and scenarios requiring loose coupling between components.

**Message Queue Architecture** - Components communicate through message brokers that store and forward messages. Functions by decoupling producers and consumers through persistent message storage. Used for handling high-volume transactions, background processing, and ensuring reliable message delivery.

**Publish-Subscribe Pattern** - Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics they're interested in. Functions by routing messages based on content or topic rather than specific destinations. Used in notification systems, real-time updates, and distributed logging.

## Data Management Patterns

**Database per Service** - Each microservice owns its data and database. Functions by eliminating shared databases and ensuring service independence. Used when services need different data storage requirements and to prevent database bottlenecks.

**Event Sourcing** - Stores all changes as a sequence of events rather than current state. Functions by rebuilding application state from event history. Used in audit-heavy applications, financial systems, and scenarios requiring complete change history.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** - Separates read and write operations into different models. Functions by optimizing read and write operations independently. Used in complex domains with different performance requirements for queries versus commands.

## Scalability Patterns

**Load Balancing** - Distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances. Functions by routing traffic to available servers using various algorithms. Used to handle high traffic volumes, ensure availability, and prevent server overload.

**Auto-scaling** - Automatically adjusts resource allocation based on demand. Functions by monitoring metrics and scaling resources up or down. Used in cloud environments to optimize costs and handle variable workloads.

**Caching Architecture** - Stores frequently accessed data in fast-access storage. Functions by reducing database load and improving response times. Used in read-heavy applications, content delivery, and performance-critical systems.

## Integration Patterns

**API Gateway** - Single entry point for client requests that routes to appropriate backend services. Functions by handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. Used in microservices architectures to simplify client interactions and centralize common functionality.

**Facade Pattern** - Provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems. Functions by hiding system complexity behind a unified interface. Used when integrating with legacy systems or simplifying complex APIs for clients.

**Adapter Pattern** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. Functions by translating between different interfaces or data formats. Used for integrating third-party services, legacy system integration, and protocol translation.

## Deployment Patterns

**Blue-Green Deployment** - Maintains two identical production environments, switching between them for deployments. Functions by routing traffic from the current version to the new version instantly. Used to minimize downtime and enable quick rollbacks.

**Canary Deployment** - Gradually rolls out changes to a subset of users before full deployment. Functions by monitoring a small percentage of traffic on the new version. Used to reduce deployment risk and validate changes in production.

**Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to failing services. Functions by monitoring failure rates and temporarily blocking requests when thresholds are exceeded. Used in distributed systems to improve stability and prevent system-wide outages.

## Security Patterns

**Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trusts, always verifies every request regardless of location. Functions by authenticating and authorizing every transaction. Used in modern security frameworks, especially for remote work and cloud-native applications.

**OAuth/OpenID Connect** - Handles authentication and authorization through token-based systems. Functions by providing secure, standardized ways to grant access to resources. Used for single sign-on, API security, and third-party integrations.

## Processing Patterns

**Batch Processing** - Processes large volumes of data in scheduled batches. Functions by collecting data over time and processing it in bulk operations. Used for data warehousing, report generation, and non-time-sensitive data processing.

**Stream Processing** - Processes data continuously as it arrives. Functions by analyzing data in real-time as it flows through the system. Used for real-time analytics, fraud detection, and live monitoring systems.

**MapReduce** - Processes large datasets by distributing work across multiple nodes. Functions by breaking problems into map and reduce phases that can be parallelized. Used for big data processing, log analysis, and distributed computing tasks.

These patterns often work together in real-world systems, with architects selecting combinations that best fit their specific requirements for performance, scalability, maintainability, and business needs.
