# Endpoints - What are they?
An endpoint is a specific point of communication in a network or system where two applications, services, or devices can connect and exchange data. Think of it as a digital address or access point where requests can be sent and responses received.

## Basic Concept

An endpoint typically consists of a URL (web address) that identifies where a service is located and how to access it. For example, `https://api.example.com/users` might be an endpoint that provides access to user data.

## Common Types of Endpoints

**API Endpoints** - Specific URLs where applications can make requests to access data or functionality. Each endpoint typically handles a specific operation like retrieving user information, creating new records, or updating existing data.

**Web Service Endpoints** - URLs that expose web services for other applications to consume, often using protocols like REST, SOAP, or GraphQL.

**Database Endpoints** - Connection points for accessing databases, including the server address, port, and connection details.

**Network Endpoints** - Any device or service on a network that can send or receive data, such as computers, printers, or IoT devices.

**Cloud Service Endpoints** - URLs provided by cloud services (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to access their various services and resources.

## Structure of an Endpoint

A typical web endpoint includes several components:
- **Protocol** (http:// or https://)
- **Domain** (api.example.com)
- **Port** (optional, like :443)
- **Path** (/users/profile)
- **Parameters** (optional, like ?id=123)

## Real-World Examples

**REST API Endpoint** - `GET https://api.weather.com/v1/current?city=London` might return current weather data for London.

**AWS S3 Endpoint** - `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com` provides access to a specific S3 storage bucket.

**Database Endpoint** - `database.company.com:5432` might be the connection point for a PostgreSQL database.

**Webhook Endpoint** - `https://myapp.com/webhooks/payment-complete` might receive notifications when payments are processed.

## Key Characteristics

**Addressable** - Each endpoint has a unique address or identifier.

**Accessible** - Endpoints are designed to be reached over a network.

**Functional** - Each endpoint typically serves a specific purpose or provides particular functionality.

**Stateless** - Many endpoints (especially REST APIs) don't maintain information about previous interactions.

Understanding endpoints is crucial for working with APIs, web services, databases, and most modern software integrations, as they define how different systems communicate with each other.
