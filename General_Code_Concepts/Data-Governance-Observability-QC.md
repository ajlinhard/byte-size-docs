# Data Quality Control (QC) Areas

Data quality control encompasses several key areas that organizations use to ensure their data is accurate, reliable, and useful for decision-making:

## Core Data QC Areas

1. **Data Validation** - Verifying that data meets defined rules and constraints
   - Format validation (correct data types, lengths)
   - Range validation (values within acceptable limits)
   - Consistency validation (logical relationships maintained)

2. **Data Cleansing** - Identifying and correcting errors in datasets
   - Removing duplicates
   - Handling missing values
   - Fixing structural errors
   - Normalizing data formats

3. **Data Completeness** - Ensuring required data is present
   - Identifying missing records or fields
   - Measuring coverage metrics
   - Flagging incomplete datasets

4. **Data Accuracy** - Confirming data correctly represents real-world entities
   - Cross-referencing against trusted sources
   - Validating calculations
   - Identifying outliers that may indicate errors

5. **Data Consistency** - Ensuring uniformity across datasets
   - Standardizing formats and units
   - Aligning values across related tables
   - Maintaining referential integrity

# Data Observability
Data observability focuses on continuously monitoring data pipelines and systems to detect, troubleshoot, and resolve issues before they impact business operations:

- **Monitoring** - Continuous tracking of data quality metrics across pipelines
- **Alerting** - Automated notifications when data anomalies are detected
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Tools to identify the origin of data issues
- **Historical Tracking** - Recording data lineage and changes over time
- **Metadata Collection** - Maintaining context about data elements

Data observability is essentially the operational layer that enables proactive data quality management rather than reactive troubleshooting.

# Data Governance
Data governance provides the organizational framework for data management:

- **Policies & Standards** - Establishing formal rules for data handling
- **Data Ownership** - Defining responsibilities for data stewardship
- **Access Control** - Managing who can view or modify data
- **Compliance** - Ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements
- **Data Catalog** - Maintaining documentation of all data assets
- **Change Management** - Procedures for implementing data changes

# How All 3 Work Together

These three components form a comprehensive approach to data quality:

- **Data QC** provides the tactical tools and methods to identify and fix data issues
- **Data Observability** enables continuous monitoring to catch issues early
- **Data Governance** establishes the organizational structure to consistently manage data quality

In mature data organizations, these areas work together in a feedback loop:
1. Governance defines quality standards and ownership
2. QC processes implement these standards
3. Observability tools monitor compliance and alert when standards aren't met
4. Governance processes use this information to refine policies and standards

This integrated approach helps organizations maintain high-quality data that can be trusted for analytics, AI/ML, and business decision-making.
