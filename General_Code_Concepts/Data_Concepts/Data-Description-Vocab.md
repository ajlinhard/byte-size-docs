# Data Description Vocabulary
When you want to talk about the different behaviors, properties, and details of data the following list is important to understand.

**For counting/quantity aspects:**
- **Multiplicity** - The number of times an element appears or how many instances exist in a relationship
- **Frequency** - How often a particular value or event occurs within a dataset
- **Magnitude** - The size or extent of a measurement, often referring to the scale of values
- **Volume** - The total amount or quantity of data, typically referring to large datasets
- **Count** - The simple numerical total of items or occurrences
- **Size** - The overall dimensions or extent of a dataset or data structure
- **Dimensionality** - The number of attributes, features, or dimensions in a dataset

**For data distribution/spread:**
- **Dispersion** - How spread out or scattered data points are from a central value
- **Variance** - A statistical measure of how much data points differ from the mean
- **Range** - The difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset
- **Breadth** - The scope or extent of coverage across different categories or domains
- **Diversity** - The variety of different types or categories present in the data
- **Heterogeneity** - The degree to which data elements are dissimilar or varied

**For data relationships:**
- **Arity** - The number of arguments or operands a function or relation takes
- **Degree** - In graph theory, the number of connections a node has; in databases, the number of attributes in a relation
- **Valence** - The number of connections or bonds an element can form with others
- **Connectivity** - How interconnected or linked different data elements are

**For data structure properties:**
- **Cardinality** - The number of distinct elements in a set or the number of records that participate in a relationship
- **Granularity** - The level of detail or precision in data representation (fine-grained vs coarse-grained)
- **Resolution** - The degree of detail or precision available in measurements or representations
- **Density** - The ratio of actual data points to possible data points in a structure
- **Sparsity** - The degree to which a data structure contains mostly empty or zero values
- **Complexity** - The degree of intricacy or sophistication in data organization or relationships

**For uniqueness/distinctness:**
- **Distinctness** - The property of being unique or different from other elements
- **Uniqueness** - The quality of being one-of-a-kind or having no duplicates
- **Variability** - The extent to which data points differ from each other
- **Heterogeneity** - The quality of being diverse or composed of dissimilar elements
