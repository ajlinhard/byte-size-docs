**Data fidelity** refers to how accurately and precisely data represents the real-world phenomenon it's supposed to capture. It's essentially the "quality" or "faithfulness" of the data to its source.

## Types of Data Fidelity

**1. High Fidelity**
- Accurate, detailed, precise representation
- Minimal loss of information
- Close to the original source

**2. Low Fidelity**
- Approximations or simplified versions
- Some information loss
- Less detail or accuracy

## Examples

**Audio:**
- High fidelity: Lossless FLAC file (44.1kHz, 16-bit)
- Low fidelity: Heavily compressed MP3 (64kbps)

**Images:**
- High fidelity: RAW camera file
- Low fidelity: Pixelated thumbnail

**Data Collection:**
- High fidelity: Sensor reading every millisecond
- Low fidelity: Manual check once per hour

**Simulation:**
- High fidelity: Physics simulation with all real-world factors
- Low fidelity: Simplified model with assumptions

## Factors Affecting Fidelity

- **Resolution**: How detailed the measurements are
- **Sampling rate**: How frequently data is captured
- **Precision**: Number of significant digits
- **Compression**: Lossy vs. lossless
- **Measurement accuracy**: Quality of sensors/instruments
- **Data transformations**: Each conversion can reduce fidelity

## Trade-offs

High fidelity data is better but:
- Requires more storage
- Takes longer to process
- Costs more to collect
- May not always be necessary

The goal is matching fidelity to your actual needs—sometimes "good enough" is better than perfect.
