# What is Sharding?

**Sharding** is a database architecture pattern where you split a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called "shards." Each shard contains a subset of the total data and runs on separate database servers. Think of it like dividing a huge library into multiple smaller libraries, where each one holds books from specific categories or letter ranges.

## How Sharding Works

### Basic Concept
Instead of one massive database handling all data:
```
Single Database: [All Users 1-1,000,000]
```

You split it across multiple databases:
```
Shard 1: [Users 1-250,000]
Shard 2: [Users 250,001-500,000]  
Shard 3: [Users 500,001-750,000]
Shard 4: [Users 750,001-1,000,000]
```

### Sharding Strategies

**1. Range-based Sharding**
- Split by value ranges (A-F, G-M, N-S, T-Z)
- Simple but can create hot spots

**2. Hash-based Sharding**
- Use hash function on key to determine shard
- Better distribution but harder to query ranges

**3. Directory-based Sharding**
- Lookup service maps keys to shards
- Flexible but adds complexity

**4. Geographic Sharding**
- Split by location (US users, EU users, Asia users)
- Great for latency, compliance requirements

## Benefits of Sharding

### **Performance**
- Smaller datasets per server = faster queries
- Parallel processing across shards
- Reduced lock contention

### **Scalability**
- Add more shards as data grows
- Scale horizontally instead of vertically
- No single point of failure

### **Cost Efficiency**
- Use smaller, cheaper servers instead of one massive one
- Pay for what you need when you need it

## Challenges of Sharding

### **Application Complexity**
- Need shard-aware application logic
- Cross-shard queries are difficult/expensive
- Rebalancing data when adding shards

### **Data Consistency**
- Transactions across multiple shards are complex
- Maintaining referential integrity
- Eventual consistency vs strong consistency trade-offs

### **Operational Overhead**
- Managing multiple database instances
- Monitoring and backup complexity
- Debugging issues across shards

## AWS Aurora and PostgreSQL Sharding

### **Aurora PostgreSQL Does NOT Provide Built-in Sharding**

AWS Aurora PostgreSQL is essentially a cloud-native version of PostgreSQL with enhanced storage and replication, but it **does not include automatic sharding capabilities**. Here's what Aurora provides instead:

### What Aurora PostgreSQL Offers

**1. Read Scaling**
```
Writer Instance (1) → Read Replicas (up to 15)
```
- One writer, multiple readers
- Not true sharding, just read scaling

**2. Storage Auto-scaling**
- Storage grows automatically up to 128TB
- Helps with storage scaling but not compute scaling

**3. High Availability**
- Multi-AZ deployment
- Automatic failover
- But still a single logical database

### Aurora Limitations for Sharding

❌ **No automatic data partitioning across instances**  
❌ **No built-in shard management**  
❌ **No transparent query routing**  
❌ **Still bound by single-writer limitations**

## Sharding Options for PostgreSQL on AWS

### **Option 1: Manual Application-Level Sharding**
```python
def get_shard(user_id):
    shard_num = hash(user_id) % NUM_SHARDS
    return shard_connections[shard_num]

# Route queries to appropriate shard
shard = get_shard(user_id)
user = shard.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", user_id)
```

### **Option 2: PostgreSQL Extensions**

**Citus (Recommended)**
- Open-source extension for PostgreSQL
- Available on AWS RDS and can be self-hosted on EC2
- Provides distributed tables and automatic sharding

```sql
-- Create distributed table
SELECT create_distributed_table('users', 'user_id');
-- Citus handles sharding automatically
```

**postgres-xl / Postgres-XC**
- Multi-master PostgreSQL cluster
- More complex setup but full PostgreSQL compatibility

### **Option 3: AWS Services for Sharding**

**Amazon RDS Proxy + Multiple RDS Instances**
- Use RDS Proxy for connection pooling
- Manually shard across multiple RDS PostgreSQL instances
- Application handles shard routing

**Amazon DynamoDB (Alternative)**
- NoSQL database with built-in sharding
- Automatic scaling and partitioning
- Different data model than PostgreSQL

### **Option 4: Third-party Solutions**

**Vitess (Google)**
- Originally for MySQL, some PostgreSQL support
- Provides sharding middleware

**FerretDB + MongoDB-compatible sharding**
- PostgreSQL backend with MongoDB API
- Gets MongoDB's sharding capabilities

## Practical Sharding Implementation

### **Simple Application-Level Example**
```javascript
// Shard configuration
const shards = [
  { id: 0, host: 'shard0.amazonaws.com', range: [0, 250000] },
  { id: 1, host: 'shard1.amazonaws.com', range: [250001, 500000] },
  { id: 2, host: 'shard2.amazonaws.com', range: [500001, 750000] },
  { id: 3, host: 'shard3.amazonaws.com', range: [750001, 1000000] }
];

function getShardForUser(userId) {
  return shards.find(shard => 
    userId >= shard.range[0] && userId <= shard.range[1]
  );
}

// Usage
const userId = 123456;
const shard = getShardForUser(userId);
const user = await queryDatabase(shard.host, `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
```

## When to Consider Sharding

### **You Need Sharding When:**
- Single database can't handle your read/write load
- Data size exceeds what one server can efficiently handle
- You need geographic distribution
- Scaling vertically becomes too expensive

### **You DON'T Need Sharding When:**
- Read replicas can handle your read load
- Your data fits comfortably on one server
- Query patterns don't allow for good sharding keys
- Application complexity isn't worth the performance gain

## Bottom Line

**AWS Aurora PostgreSQL does not provide built-in sharding.** It's excellent for scaling reads and storage, but for true horizontal scaling (sharding), you'll need to implement it at the application level or use extensions like Citus.

For most applications, Aurora's read replicas and auto-scaling storage are sufficient. Only consider sharding when you've exhausted vertical scaling options and truly need to distribute your write load across multiple database instances.

If you definitely need sharding, Citus on RDS or self-managed on EC2 is probably your best bet for PostgreSQL on AWS.
