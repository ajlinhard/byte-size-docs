# What is Vectorized Data?

Think of vectorized data like organizing a grocery store. Instead of randomly placing items throughout the store, you group similar items together - all the fruits in one section, all the dairy products in another. Vectorized data works similarly by organizing information in a structured, aligned format that computers can process much more efficiently.

At its core, vectorized data means storing the same type of information together in contiguous memory locations, rather than scattering it around. Instead of processing one item at a time, the computer can grab and work on multiple related items simultaneously.

## Simple Performance Benefits

The fundamental advantage comes from how modern processors work. Your CPU has special instructions that can perform the same operation on multiple pieces of data at once - like adding four numbers simultaneously instead of adding them one by one. This is called SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).

When data is vectorized, the processor can load a chunk of related values, apply an operation to all of them in parallel, and store the results back. This dramatically reduces the number of individual operations needed.

## Memory Access Patterns

Traditional row-based storage (like most databases) stores complete records together. If you have customer data with name, age, salary, and address, a traditional system stores all of John's information together, then all of Mary's information, and so on.

Vectorized storage flips this - it stores all the names together, all the ages together, all the salaries together. When you want to calculate the average salary, instead of jumping around memory to collect salary values from scattered records, you can read one continuous block of salary data.

This matters because modern memory systems are optimized for sequential access. Reading data that's stored next to each other is orders of magnitude faster than jumping around to different memory locations.

## Cache Efficiency and Data Locality

Modern processors have multiple levels of cache memory that sit between the CPU and main memory. These caches are much faster but much smaller than main memory. When you access data, the processor brings nearby data into cache automatically, betting that you'll need it soon.

With vectorized data, this bet pays off beautifully. When you load one salary value, the cache automatically brings in the next several salary values. Since vectorized operations typically work on adjacent data, you get extremely high cache hit rates. Traditional scattered storage often results in cache misses, forcing expensive trips to main memory.

## Compression and Encoding Benefits

Vectorized storage enables sophisticated compression techniques that are impossible with row-based storage. When you have a column of similar data types, patterns emerge that can be heavily compressed.

For example, if you have a column of timestamps that are mostly sequential, you can store just the first timestamp and then store small deltas. A column of repeated values can use run-length encoding. Sorted integer columns can use delta encoding. These techniques can reduce storage by 10x or more while actually improving query performance because there's less data to read from disk.

## Predicate Pushdown and Late Materialization

Advanced vectorized systems can evaluate filter conditions directly on compressed data without fully decompressing it. If you're looking for all transactions over $1000, the system can often determine which compressed blocks might contain such values without examining individual records.

Late materialization means the system only reconstructs full records for data that survives all filtering operations. This dramatically reduces the amount of data movement and processing required.

## NUMA and Parallel Processing Considerations

On modern multi-core systems with NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architectures, vectorized data enables more sophisticated parallelization strategies. Different CPU cores can work on different sections of the same column simultaneously, with each core maintaining good cache locality within its assigned range.

The uniform structure of vectorized data makes it much easier to partition work evenly across cores and predict memory access patterns, leading to better resource utilization and reduced contention.

## Real-World Impact

These optimizations compound dramatically. A well-designed vectorized system might be 100-1000x faster than traditional row-based storage for analytical workloads, not because of any single optimization, but because vectorization enables multiple complementary optimizations that work together synergistically.

The trade-off is that vectorized storage is typically optimized for read-heavy analytical workloads rather than transactional workloads with frequent updates to individual records. This is why you often see hybrid systems that use row-based storage for operational data and vectorized storage for analytical processing.

# Vectorizing in Memory (ex: Spark)
Exactly! Vectorization happens at multiple layers, and you're right to distinguish between storage formats and in-memory execution engines. Let me break this down:

## Storage vs. Execution Vectorization

**Storage vectorization** (like Parquet) is about how data is physically organized on disk - columns stored together, compressed, with metadata for efficient retrieval.

**Execution vectorization** (like Spark's Tungsten engine) is about how data is processed in memory during computation - organizing data in CPU-friendly formats and using vectorized operations.

## Spark's Tungsten Engine

Spark's Tungsten represents a major evolution in how Spark processes data in memory. Instead of working with individual JVM objects (which have significant overhead), Tungsten:

- **Uses off-heap memory management** to store data in dense, binary formats
- **Organizes data in columnar batches** in memory, even when reading from row-based sources
- **Leverages code generation** to create optimized machine code for specific queries
- **Applies vectorized operations** using SIMD instructions where possible

When Spark reads a Parquet file, it's getting the benefits of storage vectorization. But then Tungsten takes over and maintains that columnar organization in memory for processing.

## Memory Layout Transformation

Here's what happens: Spark might read 1000 rows from a Parquet file into memory, but instead of creating 1000 separate Java objects, Tungsten organizes this as columnar batches - essentially creating in-memory vectors for each column.

This means operations like filtering, aggregations, and joins can work on these dense arrays using vectorized CPU instructions, rather than iterating through object references.

## Code Generation and Vectorization

Tungsten goes further with "whole-stage code generation." Instead of using generic operators that work on any data type, it generates specific machine code optimized for your exact query and data types. This generated code can take full advantage of vectorized processing.

For example, instead of a generic "add two columns" function that has to check data types and handle nulls generically, it generates tight loops that add specific numeric types with minimal branching.

## Other Engines

This pattern exists across modern engines:

- **Apache Arrow** provides a standard columnar in-memory format that multiple engines can share
- **ClickHouse** uses vectorized execution throughout its processing pipeline
- **DuckDB** is built around vectorized processing from the ground up
- **Velox** (Meta's engine) provides vectorized execution for multiple query engines

## The Full Pipeline

So in a modern system, you might have:
1. **Parquet files** providing storage vectorization
2. **Spark/Tungsten** maintaining columnar organization in memory
3. **Vectorized operators** processing batches of data with SIMD instructions
4. **Code generation** creating optimized machine code for the specific workload

Each layer builds on the previous one. You can get some benefits from just storage vectorization (faster I/O, better compression), but the real performance gains come when the entire pipeline - from storage through execution - is designed around vectorized processing.

This is why reading Parquet files with a vectorized engine like modern Spark is so much faster than reading the same data with older row-based engines, even when both are reading the same columnar storage format.

# Columnar vs. Vectorized
These terms are often used together but they refer to different concepts that complement each other:

**Columnar** describes **data layout** - how information is organized in memory or storage.
**Vectorized** describes **processing approach** - how operations are performed on that data.

You can have columnar data without vectorized processing, and theoretically vectorized processing without columnar layout (though it's less common and effective).

## Columnar Data Layout

Columnar simply means storing values from the same field/attribute together:

```
Row-based:
[John, 25, Engineer] [Mary, 30, Manager] [Bob, 28, Developer]

Columnar:
Names: [John, Mary, Bob]
Ages: [25, 30, 28] 
Roles: [Engineer, Manager, Developer]
```

This layout enables better compression and more efficient I/O when you only need certain columns, but it doesn't inherently change how operations are performed.

## Vectorized Processing

Vectorized processing means applying the same operation to multiple data elements simultaneously, typically using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) CPU instructions.

```
Non-vectorized addition:
for i in range(len(ages)):
    result[i] = ages[i] + bonus[i]  # One addition per CPU cycle

Vectorized addition:
result = ages + bonus  # Multiple additions per CPU cycle using SIMD
```

## The Relationship

Columnar layout **enables** efficient vectorized processing because:

1. **Data locality**: Values of the same type are stored contiguously
2. **Type uniformity**: All values in a column have the same data type
3. **Batch operations**: You can easily grab chunks of similar data

## Real-World Examples

**Columnar storage without vectorized processing:**
- An old database that stores data column-wise but still processes one value at a time
- Reading a Parquet file but using row-by-row Python loops

**Vectorized processing on row data:**
- NumPy operations on arrays that were originally stored row-wise
- SIMD operations on data that was reorganized in memory

**Both together (most modern systems):**
- Spark's Tungsten engine
- ClickHouse
- DuckDB
- Modern analytical databases

## Why They Work So Well Together

Columnar layout provides the **foundation** for vectorized processing:

- **Memory alignment**: Columnar data naturally aligns with CPU vector register sizes
- **Type consistency**: SIMD instructions work best on uniform data types
- **Predictable access patterns**: Sequential access through columns is cache-friendly
- **Batch sizing**: Easy to grab exactly the number of elements that fit in vector registers

## Practical Impact

Consider calculating the sum of a million integers:

**Row-based, non-vectorized**: Read each record, extract the integer, add to sum → ~1M operations
**Columnar, non-vectorized**: Read integers sequentially, add to sum → ~1M operations (but better cache performance)
**Columnar, vectorized**: Read chunks of 8 integers, add them using SIMD → ~125K operations

The combination provides the maximum benefit: columnar layout gives you the data organization needed for vectorization, and vectorization gives you the parallel processing power to take advantage of that organization.

## Modern Evolution

Today's high-performance systems rarely separate these concepts. When engineers say "vectorized," they usually mean "columnar layout with vectorized processing." But understanding the distinction helps explain why some systems can be fast at I/O (good columnar storage) but slow at computation (no vectorized processing), or vice versa.
