# Mapping Spec Documentation
In data engineering, **mapping specs** (short for mapping specifications) are documents or configurations that define how data should be transformed and mapped from source systems to target systems. They serve as a blueprint for data transformation processes.

## Key Components

A typical mapping spec includes:

- **Source fields** - The original data fields from source systems (databases, APIs, files, etc.)
- **Target fields** - The destination fields in the target system or data model
- **Transformation rules** - Logic for converting, cleaning, or enriching data (e.g., date format conversions, concatenations, calculations)
- **Data types** - Source and target data types, including any type conversions needed
- **Business rules** - Validation rules, filtering conditions, or business logic to apply
- **Default values** - What to use when source data is missing or null

## Why They Matter

Mapping specs are crucial because they:

- Provide clear documentation for ETL/ELT processes
- Ensure consistency across data pipelines
- Help developers, analysts, and stakeholders understand data transformations
- Serve as requirements for building data integration code
- Aid in testing and validation of data pipelines
- Support maintenance and troubleshooting

## Example

A simple mapping spec might look like:
- **Source**: `customer_db.first_name` (VARCHAR) → **Target**: `warehouse.customer_first_name` (STRING)
- **Transformation**: Convert to uppercase, trim whitespace
- **Source**: `customer_db.created_date` (DATE) → **Target**: `warehouse.customer_created_ts` (TIMESTAMP)
- **Transformation**: Convert to UTC timezone

These specs can be maintained in spreadsheets, YAML/JSON files, or specialized data catalog tools.
