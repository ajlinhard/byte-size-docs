# Agile / Scrum Workflow
Here's the basic flow of Agile/Scrum development:

## Pre-Development Setup
**Product Backlog Creation** - The Product Owner creates a prioritized list of features, user stories, and requirements. This backlog is continuously refined and reprioritized based on business value and stakeholder feedback.

**Team Formation** - Assemble a cross-functional team typically including developers, testers, a Scrum Master (facilitator), and Product Owner (business representative).

## Sprint Structure (Usually 1-4 weeks)

**Sprint Planning** - The team selects items from the product backlog to work on during the upcoming sprint, estimates effort, and creates a sprint backlog. They commit to delivering specific functionality by sprint's end.

**Daily Standups** - Brief 15-minute daily meetings where team members share what they completed yesterday, what they're working on today, and any blockers they're facing.

**Development Work** - Team members work on their assigned tasks, collaborating closely and focusing on delivering potentially shippable increments of the product.

**Sprint Review** - At sprint's end, the team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback on what was built.

**Sprint Retrospective** - The team reflects on their process, discussing what went well, what didn't, and how they can improve in the next sprint.

## Continuous Cycle
This sprint cycle repeats continuously. The product backlog gets updated based on feedback and changing requirements. Each sprint builds upon previous work, with the goal of delivering working software frequently and adapting to change quickly rather than following a rigid long-term plan.

The key principles are collaboration, flexibility, frequent delivery, and continuous improvement based on feedback and reflection.
