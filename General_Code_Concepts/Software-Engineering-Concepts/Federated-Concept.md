# The Concept of Federation
In cybersecurity and data engineering, "federated" refers to a distributed approach where multiple independent systems, organizations, or data sources work together while maintaining their autonomy and control over their own resources.

## Federated Identity in Cybersecurity

In cybersecurity, federation typically refers to **federated identity management**. This allows users to access multiple systems or applications using a single set of credentials, without each system needing to store or manage those credentials directly. Key aspects include:

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users authenticate once and gain access to multiple federated services
- **Trust relationships**: Organizations establish agreements about how to share and verify identity information
- **Standards**: Protocols like SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect enable this federation
- **Identity providers**: One organization acts as the authoritative source for user identities, while others (service providers) trust and accept those identities

For example, when you log into a third-party app using your Google account, that's federation in action.

## Federated Systems in Data Engineering

In data engineering, federation refers to creating a unified view or access layer across distributed data sources without physically centralizing the data. This includes:

- **Federated databases**: Query multiple databases as if they were one system, while data remains distributed
- **Data federation**: Creating virtual views that aggregate data from multiple sources in real-time
- **Federated learning**: Training machine learning models across decentralized data without moving the data itself
- **API federation**: Combining multiple APIs into a single interface (like GraphQL federation)

The key principle in both domains is maintaining **autonomy** - each participating system retains control over its data and policies while enabling coordinated functionality across the federation. This approach balances collaboration with security, privacy, and organizational independence.
