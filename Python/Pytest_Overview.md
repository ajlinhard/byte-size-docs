# pytest

pytest is a powerful testing framework for Python.

## Documentation
1. [Official Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/contents.html)
2. Integration
    - [Pytest Official Documents](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/goodpractices.html)
    - [Pytest with Eric (blog)](https://pytest-with-eric.com/pytest-best-practices/pytest-ini/)
    - [Pytest with Eric pytest.ini (blog)](https://pytest-with-eric.com/introduction/pytest-pythonpath/#Project-Set-Up)

### Use Cases
- Writing and running unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests
- Automating test discovery and execution

### Pros
- Concise and readable syntax for writing tests[^1][^3]
- Powerful features like fixtures for test setup and teardown[^1][^3]
- Extensive plugin support for customization[^1][^3]
- Detailed output for easier debugging[^3]

### Cons
- Requires external installation (not part of Python standard library)[^3]
- Learning curve for advanced features[^3]


## pytest-cov

pytest-cov is a plugin for pytest that adds code coverage measurement capabilities.

### Use Cases

- Measuring code coverage during test execution
- Generating coverage reports

### Pros

- Integrates seamlessly with pytest
- Supports subprocess coverage measurement[^4]
- Compatible with pytest-xdist for distributed testing[^4]

### Cons

- Requires additional setup and configuration
- May slightly increase test execution time due to coverage measurement

## Structuring Test Folder in a Project
Depending on your python project structure your unit test folder may live outside the package code folder. If this case arises, the you can use one of 3 methods.
** Note: All 3 methods are focuesed on adjusting or adding the PYTHONPATH to the sys.path/PYTHON import mechanism.**

### 1. pytest.ini file (older but still valid approach)
```bash
[pytest]
python_paths = ./
               ./src/Book_API
```
**example project uses:**
- https://github.com/ajlinhard/DragonRegen/blob/main/pytest.ini.block

### 2. pyproject.toml setting (modern method)
This method allows for the construction and adjustments of the unit testing in the same file as other python project settings. The syntax is similar to the pytest.ini file. However, note the file host more functionalities for your project outside of unit testing. Unlike the pytest.ini. See [Python Project pyproject.toml](Python\Python Project Elements Structure and Best Practices.md) for more info, or [Pythons offical project file documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-the-package-files).
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
python_paths = [
    ".",
    "src",
    "src/Book_API"
]
```
**example project uses:**
- https://github.com/ajlinhard/DragonRegen/blob/main/pyproject.toml

### 3. conftest.py
The conftest.py file in pytest allows you to configure and customize your test environment by defining fixtures, hooks, and other settings that apply across multiple test files within a directory. Below is an overview of how to use it to adjust pytest settings effectively:

```python
# conftest.py
import pytest

def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--custom-option", action="store", default="default_value", help="Custom option description")

@pytest.fixture
def custom_option(request):
    return request.config.getoption("--custom-option")
```
