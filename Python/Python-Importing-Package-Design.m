# Common Issues:

## Issue 01: Relative Imports on the command line.
The issue is happening when using a relative import while executing on the command line. The relative import can begin to have issues.
This error is occurring because you're trying to use a relative import (`from ..sys_configs import Configs`) that's attempting to go beyond the top-level package. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.

## The Problem

Based on the search results, I can explain what's causing your error and how to fix it.

## Understanding the Problem

In Python, relative imports (using dot notation like `from ..sys_configs import Configs`) only work for modules that are already established to be within a package, and only within that package. 

When Python encounters a relative import, it uses the module's name attribute to determine its position in the package hierarchy. If the `__name__` variable doesn't contain any package information, Python treats the module as a top-level module. 

Since top-level modules don't belong to any package, the interpreter can't resolve the location of the imported module, resulting in the error you're seeing.

## What's Happening in Your Code

Looking at your file structure:
```
HatchTestProject/
├── src/
│   ├── MessageService.py
│   ├── Backend/
│   │   ├── Conversations.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── sys_configs/
│       ├── Configs.py
│       └── ...
```

In your `Conversations.py` file, you're trying to use a relative import with `from ..sys_configs import Configs`. This is attempting to go up two directory levels from the `Backend` directory, which is beyond the top-level package of your project.

## Solutions

Here are several ways to fix this issue:

### 1. Use absolute imports instead of relative imports

The simplest solution is to use absolute imports:

```python
# In Backend/Conversations.py
from src.sys_configs import Configs
```

### 2. Make your project a proper Python package

To use relative imports, make sure your project is set up as a proper Python package:

1. Add `__init__.py` files in all directories that should be packages:
   - `src/__init__.py`
   - `src/Backend/__init__.py`
   - `src/sys_configs/__init__.py`

2. Run your code as a module rather than a script using the `-m` flag:
   ```
   # Navigate to the directory that contains 'src'
   python -m src.MessageService
   ```

### 3. Modify your Python path

If you need a quick fix without changing your import statements, you can add this to the top of your script:

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
# Then use your relative imports as before
```

## Why This Happens

When you run a file directly (as a script), Python assigns it the name `__main__` rather than treating it as part of a package. This means relative imports won't work because Python doesn't recognize the file as being part of a package structure.

Relative imports rely on having package information (through the `__name__` and `__package__` variables). When a file is run directly, it doesn't have the necessary package context for relative imports to work.

## Best Practice

For maintainable code, I recommend:

1. Use absolute imports when possible - they're more explicit and less prone to errors.
2. Structure your project properly as a Python package with `__init__.py` files.
3. Use the `-m` flag when running modules that use relative imports.
