# Byte-Size-Docs
Documentation created for learning and reference by all!

## Overview:
This repository is a live wiki doc repository of different explorations of coding, architecture, and development topics prevalent today. 
We will do our best to organize all the topics and to not let the folder tree become unwieldly. We may not cover all topics, but we are open to others adding there knowledge and learning. Please submit new pages or docs to the repo.
### Requirements:
1. Write the document in markdown, or provide a brief summary of topic and contents. Then link to a webpage.
2. Any projects, repos, or code referenced in a doc, please confirm it is linked and public.
3. Provide credit and links to resources used.

I want to thank in advance all other teachers and creators referenced throughout this project. Please contribute to their funds!

## Why the Repository was started
We all have to explore new technology and topics to keep up or catch-up. This was a simple way for everyone to contribute or learn off byte size learnings of others.

## Experience in Tech:
My name is Andrew Linhard. I have been coding since high school and have experience in many areas in coding robotics, matlab, OOP, and AWS. Most of my career experience however is in data engineering: Python, SQL, Spark, Kafka, etc. While I explore programming and architecture concpets outside these areas I may not cover them in the depth an expert has. I hope those experts reach out and contribute :D
