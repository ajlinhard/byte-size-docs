# Snowflake Certifications
I have not completed these certifications myself yet. I have used the tool quite a bit. However, snowflake is a great data warehousing tool for a data engineer. The tool reminds me of cloud provider agnotic MS-SQL, database, function, stored procedures, views, and UI. While the tool is not as robust as Databricks or other cloud data tools, there is an increase in user-friendliness.
