# Issues Experienced
I will try to organize the variety of issues the best I can. But below will be walkthrough of the issues and how I solved them.


## Going from RDD to DataFrame to Table (with bad data)
If start out working with a file or data as an RDD for extra control, features, or fun. When you try to convert the data over to a DataFrame or save it as a Table, you may experience odd issues and errors.

### Why?
The RDD is a very open end structure, so when moving between the structures you need to be deliberate and thoughtful when working with bad data (aka semi-structure columns, or bad parsing on the RDD)
When converting over to a DataFrame make sure you data type and use the Row object to better verify and enforce the settings required for DataFrames and Tables to operate correctly.
** Method 1 **
```Python
# Parse each line into fields
parsed_rdd = rdd3.map(lambda line: line.split(","))
# IMPORTANT STEP 1: Use Row
from pyspark.sql import Row
users_rdd_row = parsed_rdd.map(lambda x: Row(id=x[0], Year=x[1], Title=x[2]))

from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, IntegerType, StringType

# IMPORTANT STEP 2: Set the Schema
schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", StringType(), False),
    StructField("Year", StringType(), False),
    StructField("Title", StringType(), True),
])

# To DataFrame (the dataframe needs to be typed/map() complete)
rdd_to_df = spark.createDataFrame(users_rdd_row, schema)
rdd_to_df.show(5)
rdd_to_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("users_from_rdd_row")
```
** Method 2 **
```Python
# Parse each line into fields
parsed_rdd = rdd3.map(lambda line: line.split(","))
 Bad Dataframe
# To DataFrame (the dataframe needs to be typed/map() complete with the Row object as well)
# Create structured data (e.g., convert to tuples or dictionaries)
users_rdd = parsed_rdd.map(lambda fields: (
    int(fields[0]),     # id
    int(fields[1]),     # Year
    fields[2],          # Title
))

schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", StringType(), False),
    StructField("Year", StringType(), False),
    StructField("Title", StringType(), True),
])

rdd_to_df_bad = spark.createDataFrame(users_rdd, schema)
# We can look at the first X rows if there are no issues in them
rdd_to_df_bad.show(5)
# Errors occurs here
rdd_to_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("users_from_rdd_row")

```

The  using Row objects is generally considered better than  using tuples for several reasons:

1. **Explicit Schema Definition**: Row objects allow for explicit naming of fields, making the code more readable and self-documenting. This is especially useful when working with complex schemas[1][3].

2. **Type Safety**: Row objects can enforce data types, which helps catch errors early. In , you can specify the expected types (e.g., StringType for id and Year), whereas  assumes types without explicit checks[3].

3. **Compatibility with DataFrames**: Row objects are directly compatible with Spark DataFrames, making the transition from RDDs to DataFrames seamless. This is particularly important as DataFrames are the preferred API in modern Spark applications[3][6].

4. **Accessing Fields**: With Row objects, you can access fields by name (e.g., `row.id`, `row.Year`), which is more intuitive and less error-prone than accessing tuple elements by index[3][4].

5. **Flexibility**: Row objects can easily accommodate additional fields or changes in schema without requiring changes to the access pattern throughout the code[3].

6. **Performance**: When converting to DataFrames, Row objects can be more efficiently processed by Spark's optimizer, potentially leading to better performance in complex operations[2].

While tuples can be useful for simple key-value pair operations, Row objects provide a more robust and maintainable approach for structured data processing in Spark, especially when working with DataFrames and complex schemas[2][3][6].
