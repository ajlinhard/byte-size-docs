# Spark SQL Temp Data
Great question! In Spark SQL, there are several options for creating temporary data structures, each with different scopes and behaviors:

## Temporary Views vs Other Options

### 1. **Temporary Views** (Session-scoped)
```sql
-- These are session-scoped and disappear when session ends
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW my_temp_view
USING CSV
OPTIONS (path "file.csv", header "true");

-- Can be accessed anywhere in the session
SELECT * FROM my_temp_view;
```

### 2. **Global Temporary Views** (Application-scoped)
```sql
-- These persist across multiple SparkSessions within the same application
CREATE OR REPLACE GLOBAL TEMPORARY VIEW my_global_view
USING PARQUET
OPTIONS (path "file.parquet");

-- Must be accessed with global_temp prefix
SELECT * FROM global_temp.my_global_view;
```

### 3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** (Query-scoped)
```sql
-- These only exist within a single query
WITH temp_data AS (
  SELECT * FROM csv_data WHERE value > 100
),
aggregated AS (
  SELECT category, SUM(value) as total
  FROM temp_data
  GROUP BY category
)
SELECT * FROM aggregated;
```

### 4. **Cached Tables** (Performance-focused temporary storage)
```sql
-- Create a view and cache it in memory
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW cached_data
USING PARQUET OPTIONS (path "large_file.parquet");

-- Cache the view for better performance
CACHE TABLE cached_data;

-- Use the cached data
SELECT * FROM cached_data;

-- Remove from cache when done
UNCACHE TABLE cached_data;
```

### 5. **Temporary Tables** (Delta/Hive-style, if supported)
```sql
-- Some environments support CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
-- (availability depends on catalog implementation)
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  value DOUBLE
) USING DELTA;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO temp_table VALUES (1, 'test', 10.5);
```

## Key Differences:

| Type | Scope | Persistence | Access Pattern |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Temporary View | Session | Until session ends | Direct name |
| Global Temporary View | Application | Until application ends | `global_temp.name` |
| CTE | Single Query | Query execution only | Within WITH clause |
| Cached Table | Session | Until uncached/session ends | Direct name + memory storage |
| Temporary Table | Session | Until session ends | Direct name (if supported) |

## Best Practices:

**Use Temporary Views when:**
- You need to reference data multiple times in a session
- Working with file-based data sources
- Need session-level persistence

**Use CTEs when:**
- Breaking down complex queries
- Need temporary results within a single query
- Want to improve query readability

**Use Global Temporary Views when:**
- Sharing data across multiple SparkSessions
- Working in environments with multiple concurrent sessions

**Use Cached Tables when:**
- Working with large datasets accessed multiple times
- Need to optimize performance for repeated access

So **temporary views are indeed the primary "temporary tables" of Spark SQL**, but you have these other options depending on your specific needs for scope, persistence, and performance.
